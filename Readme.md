## Project 1: Small Textbox Editor_

## Features
* my project will open text file
* It will let user close text file
* It will let your save text file
* edit text file
* create new text file

## technical section
Program launches from Editor.java class that contains main method
when user run project it will open text box with option menubar that contains file, Edit, Format, view, Help
In the file menu user can write new file and save it
Also in the file menu user can open saved file that was saved using notepad or any other text editor. 
This project follows MVC design pattern
I used lambdas expression in open method to get content on each line instead of all text on one single line.
